    title1: "üòãEasy to use",
    text1: "The Ai00 server supports various backends, including Vulkan/Dx12/openGL, which allows it to run on most personal computers with NVidia/AMD/Intel GPUs. Additionally, it supports INT8/NF4 quantization, which can result in smaller in-memory size and faster inference speed. The NF4-quantized 7B model only requires 5.5GB of VRAM, making it a highly efficient solution for running AI models on low-end hardware.",
